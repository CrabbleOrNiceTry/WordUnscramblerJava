# WordUnscramblerJava

Hey, so basically, you run this program, type in a scrambled set of letters and then get the longest possible word that can be made out 
of that set of letters. You probably will get a really funky word, because the dictionary I downloaded has a but load of words in there 95% of I don't recongnize, like ataractic. Look it up its a real word. BTW if you are trying to find where I got the dictionary here 
is the github link.

If you find anything incorrect with this program, or that it does not run please let me know.

SIGH.

So just a funny story, while I was making this project, I thought I had to make an entire trienode(tree data structure) and 
thought that it would be the best way to do it. So I was having fun with that. But about 2 hours into making that I realised I could 
just do this entire project in main, with basically one function doing it all. So I am upset and kinda Laughing my booty off at my
stupidity. I heard about a trie node and what it was and really wanted to make one so I think I forced my self into thinking that, a 
trienode was the best way to make this program. So yeah lol. I was gonna turn this in for a school project but now, this assignment
doesn't even meet all the requirements. Its kinda funny cause I am actually disappointed I figured out how to do this assignment in 
an easier fashion. On the bright side I have an entire Trienode structure written written out in java in case I ever need it haha.

Thank you!
